# 42_Piscine

This repository contains my solutions and learnings from the **42 Piscine**.

## üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What is the Pool?

The Pool is a 26-day intensive coding bootcamp and the admission process for 42 schools. It's a deep dive into project-based, peer-to-peer learning where candidates are challenged to solve programming problems from scratch. There are no teachers or formal lectures‚Äîonly challenges, collaboration, and self-learning.

## üìö Projects

This repository includes my work on the following projects from the Pool curriculum:

*   **Shell 00:** Introduction to the terminal and basic Unix commands.
*   **Shell 01:** Shell scripting, permissions, and environment variables.
*   **C 00:** First steps in C - pointers, arrays, and basic functions.
*   **C 01:** Pointers, memory allocation, and more advanced concepts.
*   **C 02:** String manipulation, character arrays, and complex logic.
*   **...** *(Add the specific projects you completed)*
*   **Rush 00 / Exam:** Timed group projects and individual exams.

## üéØ Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to document my journey and progression during this challenging process. It serves as a portfolio of my early achievements in low-level programming and my adaptation to the 42 learning philosophy.

## üí° Skills Developed

*   **C Programming:** Logic, pointers, memory allocation, and basic data structures.
*   **Shell Scripting:** Task automation and mastery of the Unix environment.
*   **Git & GitHub:** Version control and repository management.
*   **Self-Learning:** Ability to research, read documentation, and grasp new concepts independently.
*   **Peer-to-Peer Learning:** Collaboration, code review, and mutual problem-solving.
*   **Resilience & Time Management:** Working effectively under pressure and tight deadlines.

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation

Each C exercise is compiled individually using `gcc`.

**Basic compilation:**
```bash
gcc file_name.c -o output_name
